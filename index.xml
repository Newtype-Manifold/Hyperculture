      <description>Hyperculture is a philosophy and community built around an approach to making, taking care of and handling garments and other objects throughout their life and end of life.
Inspired by the fact that in a lot of indigenous cultures, objects were considered to be entities in their own right. With the spirit of the maker said to imbued into exemplary ones. Objects were entangled with the lives of their owners and the times they existed in.</description>

      <description>The Year Garment is a speculative object realised as part of a worldbuilding exercise for Newtype Studios. Developed further under the Hyperculture Manifold, it is imagined as a common item that people own, the year garment was seen as a garment that acted not only as an item of clothing, but also as a way of recording, transmitting and encoding experiences and knowledge.
The Year Garment exhibition was put together with support from the British Council and Ellen MacArthur Foundation as part of their Circular Design Lab 2019 grant.</description>
