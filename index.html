<h3 id="year-garments">Year Garments</h3>
<p>One of the signature garments produced by Hyperculture, a year garment can take a variety of forms. What makes any garment a year garment is whether or not it is marked using hypermarks and treated as an object being taken care of for future custodians.</p>
<p>This means that any item of clothing can be called a year garment, and not just clothes designed specifically to be one.</p>
<p>In this way, the year garment is not designed, but is something created out of a practice of marking.</p>
<p>Year garments are not treated as disposable, but are either traded, handed down or upcycled - their messages and stories added to whatever new garment is made from their remains.</p>
<p>Eventually, we will build a digital repository for custodians to track the ownership of, and the records stored on, these garments in order to facilitate their persistence and transmission into the future.</p>

<p><em>Hyperculture</em> is a philosophy and community built around an approach to making, taking care of and handling garments and other objects throughout their life and end of life.</p>
<p>Inspired by the fact that in a lot of indigenous cultures, objects were considered to be entities in their own right. With the spirit of the maker said to imbued into exemplary ones. Objects were entangled with the lives of their owners and the times they existed in. Even today, items belonging to certain personalities or that lived through particular eras are especially prized. Existing simultaneously as singular items with souls and as hyper-objects in the sense of <em>hyper-text</em>; relating to other objects and other hyper-objects, like their owners, former custodians, cultures and the maker traditions that informed their creation.</p>

<p>The Life of Objects exhibition was put together by Newtype Studios in collaboration with Yemi Awosile with support from the <a href="https://www.britishcouncil.org/">British Council</a> and <a href="https://www.ellenmacarthurfoundation.org/">Ellen MacArthur Foundation</a> as part of their Circular Design Lab 2019 programme held in November 2019.</p>
<p>The 2019 cohort was comprised of a selection of design practitioners from all over the African continent and focused on how to propagate circular design and economic principles in various countries and sectors throughout Africa.</p>

<hr>
<p>The exhibition is comprised of a design proposal we are calling the <em>Year Garment</em>, which is a type of garment originally conceived as a cultural artifact that was part of a speculative fiction project that is being developed by Newtype Studios.</p>

<p>Developed further under the Hyperculture project, it is imagined as not only an item of clothing, but also as a medium for the recording, transmitting and encoding experiences and knowledge.</p>
<hr>
<p>The second component is a short narrative following the lives of three generations in a family through the perspective of a particular Year Garment that is handed down.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;An abstract journey through the symbols etched into the fabric of a year garment over three generations of a family. A gift is given, graduation, a first job, love, childbirth, death, mourning, healing, growth and gifting again.&quot;</em></p>

<p>As part of the exhibition, Yemi also created a series of textiles showcasing the various <em>hypermarks</em> created for the Hyperculture project.</p>
<p>The hypermarks language is made up of a series of ideograms each one symbolising a certain type of event, emotion or relationship. They work on their own and can be used in conjunction with one another in order to create new meanings.</p>
